        <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Bayesian Optimisation with Simulation Input Uncertainty:</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br> Bayesian optimisation has proven a very sampling-efficient simulation optimisation algorithm. However, in many cases, the input parameters of the simulation model (e.g., arrival time distributions) are not precisely known. In this talk, I will present how Bayesian optimisation can handle input uncertainty, and even decide whether it is more beneficial to spend additional simulation effort, or collect additional data to reduce the input uncertainty. Finally, we will discuss how the presented framework can also be used in interactive multi-objective optimisation to decide when and how often to interact with a decision maker.</p>

        <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Maximizing Impact with Few Trials Using High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br> Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a class of powerful surrogate-based, iterative techniques for the optimization of expensive black-box functions. In this talk, I will provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art methodologies in high-dimensional BO, focusing on strategies that address the curse of dimensionality and maximize efficiency and accuracy within small evaluation budgets.
I will present a range of techniques, including variable selection, additive models, and methods for search space reduction such as the use of trust regions and both linear and nonlinear mappings. Additionally, I will discuss case studies demonstrating the application of BO in engineering design, highlighting its significant potential for solving complex problems in both academic and industrial contexts. The presentation will conclude with an examination of current challenges and open questions in the field, identifying key areas for future research.

        <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Multiobjective Optimization Method for Problems with Expensive Objective Function Evaluations: Optimistic NAUTILUS Navigator</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>Real-world multiobjective optimization problems often involve expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. One way to solve such problems is through the use of so-called online data-driven multiobjective optimization algorithms. These algorithms use data (either pre-existing or generated before optimization) to train surrogate models to replace the expensive objective functions during optimization to generate an approximate non-dominated front. Notably, these algorithms evaluate a few solutions intermittently using the expensive objective functions and retrain the surrogate models to increase the accuracy of the approximation. In practice, however, often, the goal in solving multiobjective optimization problems is to find only one (or few) solutions that are of interest to a decision maker/problem owner. Therefore, spending expensive objective function evaluations with the aim of finding solutions that may not be of interest to the DM may be wasteful.</p>
      <p>In this talk, we showcase an interactive method called O-NAUTILUS, which merges ideas from evolutionary multiobjective optimization and multiple criteria decision making communities. It extends the ideas of trade-off free search and navigation provided by the NAUTILUS Navigator method to surrogate-assisted optimization. It utilizes uncertainty quantification from surrogate models like Kriging or properties like Lipschitz continuity to approximate a so-called optimistic Pareto optimal set. This enables the decision maker to search in unexplored parts of the Pareto optimal set and requires a small amount of expensive objective function evaluations. These evaluations are focused on the decision maker's region of interest, thus making sure that expensive function evaluations are utilized efficiently. O-NAUTILUS comes with a graphical user interface, allowing a decision maker to control the optimization and decision-making process in real-time using intuitive controls.</p>
