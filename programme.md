      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Real-world multiobjective optimization problems often involve expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. One way to solve such problems is through the use of so-called online data-driven multiobjective optimization algorithms. These algorithms use data (either pre-existing or generated before optimization) to train surrogate models to replace the expensive objective functions during optimization to generate an approximate non-dominated front. Notably, these algorithms evaluate a few solutions intermittently using the expensive objective functions and retrain the surrogate models to increase the accuracy of the approximation. In practice, however, often, the goal in solving multiobjective optimization problems is to find only one (or few) solutions that are of interest to a decision maker/problem owner. Therefore, spending expensive objective function evaluations with the aim of finding solutions that may not be of interest to the DM may be wasteful.</p>
      <p>In this talk, we showcase an interactive method called O-NAUTILUS, which merges ideas from evolutionary multiobjective optimization and multiple criteria decision making communities. It extends the ideas of trade-off free search and navigation provided by the NAUTILUS Navigator method to surrogate-assisted optimization. It utilizes uncertainty quantification from surrogate models like Kriging or properties like Lipschitz continuity to approximate a so-called optimistic Pareto optimal set. This enables the decision maker to search in unexplored parts of the Pareto optimal set and requires a small amount of expensive objective function evaluations. These evaluations are focused on the decision maker's region of interest, thus making sure that expensive function evaluations are utilized efficiently. O-NAUTILUS comes with a graphical user interface, allowing a decision maker to control the optimization and decision-making process in real-time using intuitive controls.</p>
      <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Bhupinder Singh Saini is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Multiobjective Optimization Group at the University of Jyv채skyl채. He received his M.Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2018 and his PhD from the University of Jyv채skyl채 in 2022. His research interests include multiobjective optimization, interactive methods, data visualization, online and offline data-driven optimization, development of evolutionary algorithms, and real-world applications.
