# About BOSS

In many real world optimisation problems evaluating the objective function(s) is expensive, perhaps requiring days of computation for a single evaluation. Surrogate-assisted optimisation attempts to alleviate this problem by employing computationally cheap 'surrogate' models to estimate the objective function(s) or the ranking relationships of the candidate solutions.

Bayesian Optimisation, and Surrogate-assisted approaches more generally, have been widely used across the field of optimisation. Surrogates have been employed in solving a variety of optimisation problems, such as multi-objective optimisation, dynamic optimisation, and robust optimisation. Surrogate-assisted methods have also found successful applications to aerodynamic design optimisation, structural design optimisation, data-driven optimisation, chip design, drug design, robotics and many more. Interestingly, the need for on-line learning of the surrogates has led to a fruitful crossover between the machine learning and evolutionary optimisation communities, where advanced learning techniques such as ensemble learning, active learning, semi-supervised learning and transfer learning have been employed in surrogate construction.

Despite recent successes in using surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimisation, there remain many challenges. The Workshop on Bayesian and surrOgate aSsisted Search and Optimisation (BOSS) to be held at PPSN 2024 in Hagenberg, Austria, aims to promote the research on Bayesian Optimisation and surrogate-assisted optimisation, particularly those that take inspiration from nature. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
