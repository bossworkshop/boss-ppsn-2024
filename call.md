We invite authors/participants to submit new ideas, positional statements, and reviews/summaries/comments/techniques on Bayesian and surrogate-assisted search and optimisation. Accepted abstracts will be asked to provide a 15 minute talk with 5 minutes for questions. All presentations will be in-person and submissions are understood to indicate the authors intention to attend in person when submitting.

We especially welcome submissions from early career researchers and PhD's. 

---

Submissions should be in the form of 1-page abstracts (1 page abstract PDF file). 

Please send your submissions to [George De Ath](mailto:g.de.ath@exeter.ac.uk)
