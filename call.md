We invite authors/participants to submit new ideas, positional statements, and reviews/summaries/comments/techniques on Bayesian and surrogate-assisted search and optimisation. We especially welcome submissions from early career researchers and PhD's. Submissions should be in the form of 1-page abstracts (1 page abstract PDF file). 

**NOTE** - Submissions will not be published in the conference proceedings unless already accepted through the conference submission process. 

Please send your submissions to [George De Ath](g.de.ath@exeter.ac.uk)
